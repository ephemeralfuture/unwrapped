##A simple web-calculator for weighed goods for use on mobile

###Designed for market stalls but easily adaptable for anyone

This is a basic HTML-based web-app calculator to keep a running total of weighed goods.
It was made for a specific packaging free business, and adapted from code found  at https://html.form.guide/calculation-forms/simple-html-calculation-form/

My main changes were in UX, with some updates to the JavaScript. This included optimising the calculations, making it adaptable to different items, styling the running totals so that they are mobile friendly.

I plan to automate more of this code, including sending receipts to keep stock totals and using arrays to better control the calculations.

For now, the current version is free for anyone to use, download, update or adapt.
