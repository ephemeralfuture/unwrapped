## A simple web-calculator for weighed goods for use on mobile

### Designed for market stalls but easily adaptable for anyone

This is a basic HTML-based web-app calculator to keep a running total of weighed goods. It was made for a specific packaging free business, and adapted from code found at https://html.form.guide/calculation-forms/simple-html-calculation-form/

The webpage can be used locally or online, and the entire HTML, CSS and JavaScript are included here in one HTML5 file. A list of items with prices, weights and automatic calculations are stored in a list.

My main changes to the simple form linked aboce were in UX, with some updates to the JavaScript. This included optimising the calculations, making it adaptable to different items, styling the running totals so that they are mobile friendly.

I plan to automate more of this code, including sending receipts to keep stock totals and using arrays to better control the calculations.

For now, the current version is free for anyone to use, download, update or adapt.
